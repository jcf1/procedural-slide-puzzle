"OBJECTIVE:  Navigate the blue block to the red block by sliding and colliding with the black blocks on the board. If you slide off the board, you will be put back into the starting position.",
"CONTROLS:   Use the arrow keys to control the blue block.",
"OPTIONS:    Change the level by changing the \"Random Seed\" value above and click the \"Make Puzzle\" button. The Random Seed button will generate a new \"Random Seed\" for you. Setting the \"Fake Blocks\" option will add blocks that are not required for the level's solution to the board making it more difficult."
